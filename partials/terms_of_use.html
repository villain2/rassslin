				<h3>GOVERNING LAW AND ARBITRATION</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>a.  Governing Law.  You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in Maryland; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over AOE Studios, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Maryland.  This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Maryland, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. </li>
					<li>b.  Arbitration.  For any dispute with AOE Studios, you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:support@webchannel24.com" title="Email Support">support@webchannel24.com</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.  In the unlikely event that AOE Studios has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any AOE Studios claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.  Unless you and AOE Studios agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules.  The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights.  ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS.  YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND AOE STUDIOS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.  </li>
